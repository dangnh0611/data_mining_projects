# data_mining_projects
Some mini projects for Introduction to Data mining techniques 
>Note that notebooks are not all focus on challenge solving, but experiments and comparations with some models/algorithms/engineering techniques 

The following mini projects included:
  - [1. bbc_text_categorization](#1-bbc_text_categorization)
  - [2. emnist_handwriten_character_digits_recognition](#2-emnist_handwriten_character_digits_recognition)
  - [3. fake_jobs_classification](#3-fake_jobs_classification)
  - [4. market_basket_association_rules](#4-market_basket_association_rules)
  - [5. mushrrom_classification](#5-mushrrom_classification)
  - [6. people_interest_clustering](#6-people_interest_clustering)
  - [7. red_wine_quality](#7-red_wine_quality)
